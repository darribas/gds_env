Can I still run gds_env? | Who is behind the gds_env | . What is a container? . A container is like a “box” that contains a entirely self-sufficient software stack. You can think of containers as fully packaged apps that, once built, can be transferred from one machine to another and will run exactly the same code, byte by byte. If you are familiar with virtual machines (VMs), containers are a bit like that, but much more lightweight, and starting them up is a lot faster. For that reason, they have become the standard in the tech industry to run almost everything in production. The gds_env project provides three main containers (gds_py, gds and gds_dev) which allow you to run a JupyterLab instance seamlessly without having to install anything else. In this case, the container includes Jupyter Lab and all the packages each stack includes, but also all the plugins, additional dependencies and other requirements that you would need to install to be able to run the libraries you want to successfully. Why is gds_env not a desktop app? . A modern software stack for (geospatial) scientific computing is a very complex and delicate construction. For the final product (e.g. JupyterLab) to work, several pieces need to be in the right place and in the right shape. For example, several Python and R geospatial libraries (e.g. geopandas or sf) rely on libraries for much of the heavy lifting (e.g. GDAL). These libraries are written in low-level languages such as C/C++ and need to be compiled with the appropriate options, which are tailored to the operating system, version of other packages, etc. This is already complicated enough to expect beginners to do it. Furthermore, even if originally the stack is installed correctly on a desktop, this can change if new libraries are installed subsequently, breaking the install of the earlier libraries. This is not fun, and no end-user should have to deal with this just because they want to make the most of modern geospatial software. Containers help in this context because the offload all the technical details of an install away from the end-user. Once the container is built and works correctly, it can be transferred to any other platform that with Docker (or Virtualbox) installed and it will run just as it does on the original setup. No hairy installation guides. Just flashing the container with one command. Building a container instead of a desktop app has additional benefits. The range of setups in which it can be run is wider. A container can be run on almost any laptop; but it can also be run on a server, a super-computer, or in the cloud in several forms. This streamlines a lot how a user can learn, protoype and deploy analysis. You can learn Python on your laptop, then apply what you learn on a research project and, when the data or requirements of the analysis grow too big for your laptop, move it to a server or the cloud without intermediate install headaches. If it works on your laptop, it will work anywhere. Why several stacks? Why not just one? . Containers are great because they package up everything you need to run an app, but this can take storage. Furthermore, many usecases do not require a full stack of Python, R and development tools. To be able to be a bit more nimble and provide smaller footprints for use cases that do not require the entire list of software packages, the gds_env is split into three, incremental, stacks. It is important to note that the stacks are layered on top of each other. This means that if you install the three of them, you will only really need the space of the largest one (gds_dev), as Docker is smart enough to combine layers from different containers without repetition. Can gds_env be installed and run without advanced technical skills? . Yes! In fact, this is one of the main goals of the project. Building a container can be tricky but, once someone has built it, installing it is much more straightforward. The idea of the gds_env project is to provide built containers, that provide access to state-of-the-art software for Geographic Data Science and that can be installed and run by non-technical audiences. If you are an end-user, we provide guides to run gds_env containers on Docker and Virtualbox. If you are a more advanced developer and want to build and deploy your own containers, we also provide guides for Docker, Virtualbox and Vagrant. Do I need to build my own gds_env to be able to run it? . No. Every six months, a new version of the gds_env is built and released (check out the list of releases for more details). You can use those containers directly without having to build them yourself. Instead, you can just install and run them on Docker or Virtualbox. Is the gds_env suitable for teaching environments? . Absolutely! One of the original reasons why the project got off the ground was the need, within the Geographic Data Science Lab to deploy complex scientific stacks for Python and R to students who are learning to code for the first time. If you are using the gds_env to help you teach Python and R, we would love to hear from your experiences! Feel free to drop Dani a line at D.Arribas-Bel [at] liverpool.ac.uk. Can I run the gds_env on a machine without administrative rights? . Yes. Docker does require administrative priviledges on the user to run containers. However, if your environment does not allow this (e.g. machines managed by universities or employers), you can run them on Virtualbox (see the guide to install on Virtualbox). Alternatively, if you are a bit more tech savvy, you can try Syngularity, which is a project that allows you to run containers on Linux without administrative priviledges. My Windows Laptop does not support Docker. Can I still run gds_env? . Yes. Virtualbox is a virtualisation tool that can be installed on any recent version of Windows (XP and above) and on almost any other platform. Please see the guide to install the gds_env using Virtualbox. Who is behind the gds_env . The gds_env was originally an idea by Dani Arribas-Bel (@darribas) to manage his own scientific software installs for research, and his teaching (mostly at the Geographic Data Science Lab). However, the project has grown a bit and now a few more people have contributed. You can have a look at the full list of contributors and if you would like to get involved, see the guidance on contributing. It’d be terrific to have you on board! . ",

At the core of all of them are the images described in Stacks, and each can be deployed through these delivery channels. Currently, two approaches are supported: Docker and Virtualbox. If available, the recommended way is through Docker, which is a more lightweight solution and can be more efficient and scalable. However, Docker is not always an option (e.g. some versions of Windows or systems for users without administrative rights). For these cases, a more widely available option is a full-fledge virtual machine such as VirtualBox. The guides cover two different user scenarios: build and install. Install guides are geared towards end users who want to run the one of the gds_env flavours on their machine; build guides are designed to document the process used to create available images and hence will probably be more useful for more advanced users or administrators (e.g. lecturers)who want to prepare a new image for deployment.

    "content": ". | Dani Arribas-Bel [@darribas] | . The gds_env (short for “GDS environment”) provides a modern platform for Geographic Data Science. The project is a Jupyter-based stack that includes state-of-the-art geospatial libraries for Python and R. The gds_env is based on container technology to make it a transferrable platform for reproducibility. The source code is released under an open source license and the build process is transparent. The gds_env extends the official Jupyter Docker Stack to include geospatial functionality in both Python and R. To offer more flexibility, this extension is provided in three different flavours, or stacks (to ): gds_py, gds and gds_dev. Each of them builds on each other and adds further functionality. Please check the Stacks section for more information. The goal of the gds_env is to make using Python and R for geospatial easy to set up in a large variety of contexts. The gds_env can support research and teaching activities, but is also suitable for data scientists using Python and R “in the field”. The stacks can be used in a range of environments, including: Windows/Mac/Linux laptops and desktops, servers, compute clusters, supercomputers or in the cloud (e.g. you can deploy them on Binder). For more information on how to build or install any of the stacks, check the Guides section. ",
