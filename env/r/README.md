# Python + R: `gds`

The `gds` flavour contains a full [`gds_py`](../gds_py) stack, as well as an entire R stack. This includes the following:

- An R stack composed of a list of libraries designed to closely mirror that provided by the excellent [`rocker/geospatial`](https://github.com/rocker-org/geospatial) project.
- An R kernel for Jupyter Lab/Notebook, provided by the [`IRkernel`](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) project.
- An interface to R from Python Jupyter notebooks, provided by [`rpy2`](https://bitbucket.org/rpy2/rpy2) project.
