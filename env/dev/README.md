# Python + R + dev tools: `gds_dev`

## Contents

The `gds_dev` flavour contains a full [`gds`](../gds) stack, plus a few development tools geared towards open source computing. Broadly speaking, these include:

- [`decktape`](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape), for building high-quality PDF files from HTML slides.
- [`jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/), for building static websites.
- [`tippecanoe`](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe), to create vector tilesets.
- A full-fledge install of the [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) editor.
