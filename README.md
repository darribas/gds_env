The `gds_env` (short for "GDS environment") provides a modern platform for Geographic Data Science. The project is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)-based stack that includes state-of-the-art **geospatial** libraries for **Python** and **R**. The `gds_env` is based on **container** technology to make it a transferrable platform for reproducibility. The source code is released under an [open source license](https://github.com/darribas/gds_env/blob/master/LICENSE) and the build process is transparent.

The `gds_env` extends the official [Jupyter Docker Stack](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to include geospatial functionality in both Python and R. To offer more flexibility, this extension is provided in three different flavours, or stacks (to ): [`gds_py`](stacks/gds_py), [`gds`](stacks/gds) and [`gds_dev`](stacks/gds_dev). Each of them builds on each other and adds further functionality. Please check the [Stacks section](stacks) for more information.

The goal of the `gds_env` is to make using Python and R for geospatial easy to set up in a large variety of contexts. The `gds_env` can support research and teaching activities, but is also suitable for data scientists using Python and R "in the field". The stacks can be used in a range of environments, including: Windows/Mac/Linux laptops and desktops, servers, compute clusters, supercomputers or in the cloud (e.g. you can deploy them on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)). For more information on how to build or install any of the stacks, check the [Guides section](guides).

## Building blocks

The `gds_env` stands on the shoulders of giants. Here are the core open technologies it is built with:
